## Coverage Report

**Initial Coverage (Expected for Setup Phase):**
- Lines: 4.31% (will increase as more tests are added)
- Functions: 14.18%
- Branches: 28.89%
- Statements: 4.31%

**Note:** Low coverage is expected at this stage since we only created 2 example test files. The infrastructure is in place for expanding coverage in future phases.

**Coverage Reports Generated:**
- `coverage/index.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `coverage/lcov.info` - LCOV format for CI/CD
- Console output with detailed statistics

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing Coverage Package
**Problem:** `@vitest/coverage-v8` was not initially installed  
**Solution:** Installed the package separately  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Async Function Tests
**Problem:** Tests were not awaiting async `selectBeneficiary()` calls  
**Solution:** Added `async/await` to all test functions  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem:** Tests expected `coordinates` and `name` properties that don't exist in actual types  
**Solution:** Updated tests to match actual [`Village`](src/types/database.ts:58) and [`Family`](src/types/database.ts:72) type definitions  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 4: ErrorLogger Method
**Problem:** Test called `errorLogger.getStats()` which doesn't exist  
**Solution:** Used the exported [`getErrorStats()`](src/services/errorLogger.ts:57) function instead  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Test Execution Time:** 7.23 seconds for 12 tests
- **Setup Time:** 599ms
- **Collection Time:** 317ms
- **Environment Setup:** 2.15s
- **Average Test Duration:** ~602ms per test

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2.1 has been successfully completed with a fully functional Vitest testing infrastructure. All 12 initial tests are passing, comprehensive documentation is in place, and the foundation is set for expanding test coverage in future phases.

The testing framework is production-ready and follows industry best practices for modern React/TypeScript applications.
