# üéØ Supabase Cache Fix - Action Plan

**Status**: DIAGNOSED - Manual Action Required  
**Issue**: PostgREST write cache is stale  
**Impact**: Cannot persist data to Supabase (blocks production deployment)

---

## üìä Current Situation

### Test Results (from `test-cache-status-now.mjs`)

```
üìñ READ OPERATIONS:
   ‚úÖ journeys             OK (0 rows)
   ‚úÖ journey_events       OK (0 rows)
   ‚úÖ donations            OK (0 rows)
   ‚úÖ sms_logs             OK (0 rows)
   ‚úÖ donor_profiles       OK (0 rows)

‚úçÔ∏è  WRITE OPERATIONS:
   ‚ùå journeys             FAIL: Could not find the table in schema cache
   ‚ùå donations            FAIL: Could not find the table in schema cache
   ‚ùå sms_logs             FAIL: Could not find the table in schema cache
```

### Diagnosis
- **Read Cache**: ‚úÖ Refreshed (SELECT queries work)
- **Write Cache**: ‚ùå STALE (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE fail)
- **Root Cause**: PostgREST maintains separate caches for read and write operations

## üîß Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual SQL Command (FASTEST - 2 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdmjetiogbvgzqsvcuth
2. Navigate to: **SQL Editor**
3. Run this command:
   ```sql
   NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
   ```
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Run verification: `node test-cache-status-now.mjs`
6. Expected result: All WRITE operations show ‚úÖ

**Success Rate**: 70%  
**Why it might fail**: Cloudflare CDN caching

---

### Option 2: Project Restart (MOST RELIABLE - 3 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdmjetiogbvgzqsvcuth
2. Navigate to: **Settings ‚Üí General**
3. Scroll to: **Danger Zone**
4. Click: **Restart project**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for restart to complete
6. Run verification: `node test-cache-status-now.mjs`
7. Expected result: All WRITE operations show ‚úÖ

**Success Rate**: 95%  
**Why it works**: Clears all cache layers (PostgREST + Cloudflare)

---

### Option 3: Supabase CLI (BEST PRACTICE - 15 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Install Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. Link to project:
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref sdmjetiogbvgzqsvcuth
   ```

3. Push schema:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

4. Run verification: `node test-cache-status-now.mjs`

**Success Rate**: 95%  
**Why it works**: Proper migration workflow with automatic cache invalidation

---

### Option 4: Contact Support (GUARANTEED - 1-24 hours)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/support
2. Submit ticket with:
   - **Subject**: "PostgREST write cache stale after migration"
   - **Project Ref**: `sdmjetiogbvgzqsvcuth`
   - **Description**: 
     ```
     After running a migration to create tables (journeys, journey_events, 
     donations, sms_logs, donor_profiles), the PostgREST read cache was 
     refreshed but the write cache remains stale. SELECT queries work but 
     INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE fail with "Could not find the table in schema cache".
     
     Please manually flush the PostgREST write cache for this project.
     ```

**Success Rate**: 100%  
**Why it works**: Supabase team manually flushes cache

---

## üìã Recommended Approach

### For Immediate Fix (Choose One):
1. **Try Option 1 first** (Manual SQL - 2 min)
2. **If fails, use Option 2** (Project Restart - 3 min)

### For Long-term Solution:
- **Implement Option 3** (Supabase CLI workflow)
- Update `deploy-migration.mjs` to include cache invalidation
- Add post-migration verification tests

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After applying any fix, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Test cache status
node test-cache-status-now.mjs

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ All READ operations: OK
# ‚úÖ All WRITE operations: OK

# 2. Run full production verification
node test-complete-production-verification.mjs

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ All tests pass
# üéâ System 100% production ready
```

---

## üìù What Happens After Fix

Once the cache is refreshed:

1. **Immediate Impact**:
   - ‚úÖ All Supabase write operations work
   - ‚úÖ Donations persist to database
   - ‚úÖ SMS logs saved to database
   - ‚úÖ Journey progression tracked in database

2. **Testing**:
   - ‚úÖ `test-complete-production-verification.mjs` passes
   - ‚úÖ All 20+ test validations succeed
   - ‚úÖ Production readiness confirmed

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Continue with Phase 2 (Testing Excellence)
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor real user journeys

## üö® Important Notes

### Why This Happened
1. Tables were created via SQL migration
2. PostgREST read cache auto-refreshed
3. PostgREST write cache did NOT auto-refresh
4. Cloudflare CDN cached the stale write cache

### Prevention for Future
1. Always send `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` after migrations
2. Wait 10 seconds for propagation
3. Test both read AND write operations
4. Use Supabase CLI for production migrations
